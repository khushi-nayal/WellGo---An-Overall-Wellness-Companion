# WellGo-An-Overall-Wellness-Companion


Abstract: 

In recent times, taking care of our mental health has become a huge problem, for teens and adults alike. To help this process, we have aimed to make an application where individuals can visit one place to keep their overall health and wellbeing in check. This is an interactive and dynamic application for our own development and encompasses several kinds of wellbeing we have identified as major categories. Feelings of wellbeing are fundamental to the overall health and development of an individual.

Focus: 

Primarily, we had to determine what aspects we wanted to target for our application. After observing our surroundings and conducting a short survey from a variety of age groups, we identified the kinds of wellbeing we had to target, adding it to what we felt was lacking in our own life. We covered:
Emotional Wellness
Physical Wellness
Financial Wellness
Social Wellness

Features: 

On our home page, we have four icons in the centre depicting the four kinds of wellness we have options for, with an appropriate icon for each. On the bottom, we have the functionality to submit feedback for the application, where we can rate it on a scale of 1-5, and submit a review as well. 

Emotional Wellness:

  1. Daily goals and self care: Tracking the steps of our daily life is imperative in knowing what we are doing wrong and monitoring our life to understand whether we      are on the right path. 
     In this we have the functionality to add events and delete them, and also colour code them to please our aesthetic and identify them accordingly. 
     We can add descriptions, date and time, and members (friends/family/colleagues) we have the event with. 
	   We can add notes, colour code them, and also make checklists. 

  2. Mood Tracker: This is a tool that helps us keep a record of our mood throughout different parts of the day. We can monitor how our mood is affected by the              circumstances around us and keep control. 
     In the mood tracker, we can select the emotions we are feeling from the ones displayed and pick a date, time and activity we were doing at that time. After a          period of time, the application displays analytics of our mood and behaviour over a duration of time.

  3. Mindfulness meditation: Meditation is a practice where an individual uses a technique – such as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a particular object, thought,      or activity – to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state.
     Breathing Exercises- an exercise intended to promote effective and healthy breathing and breath control. 


  4. Medication Reminder: Patients that regularly consume medication/ pills have the ability to schedule time and record the number of pills for a required amount of        doses to keep track of their consumption. 


Physical Wellness:

   1. Diet Plan Recommendation - Most people associate diets with short-term weight loss and restrictive food intake. However, a diet plan is tailored to an                 individual's health status, weight and lifestyle, along with their weight loss and health goals.
      We can browse popular recipes, recommendations, and favorite the ones we like. 
		
   2. Workout  Recommendation  - Exercise helps people lose weight and lower the risk of some diseases. Exercising regularly lowers a person's risk of developing some       diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure. Exercise also can help keep your body at a healthy weight. Exercise can help a person age       well.
		
   3. Yoga  Recommendation - The art of practicing yoga helps in controlling an individual's mind, body and soul. It brings together physical and mental disciplines to       achieve a peaceful body and mind; it helps manage stress and anxiety and keeps you relaxing. It also helps in increasing flexibility, muscle strength and body         tone.

   4. Sleep tracker - Sleep tracking is the process of monitoring a person's sleep, most commonly through measuring inactivity and movement. A device that tracks a           person's sleep is called a sleep tracker.
   
   
Social Wellness:

   1. Connect to users- Social connection can lower anxiety and depression, help us regulate our emotions, lead to higher self-esteem and empathy, and actually improve       our immune systems. By neglecting our need to connect, we put our health at risk. 

Financial Wellness: 

  1. Budget tracker- a complete online money management tool designed to keep track of all your transactions and bank accounts from your computer, mobile phone, or          iPad.
	
  2. Investments Recommendation - An investment recommendation means information recommending or suggesting an investment strategy, explicitly or implicitly,                concerning one or several financial instruments or the issuers, including any opinion as to the present or future value or price of such instruments.
